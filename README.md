# <sub>Hi, DÃ©bora speaking!
###### I'm a full stack developer currently in my second year at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, studying Information Systems. 
###### In the first half of 2023 I built, alongside a few of my classmates, a Discord Bot that generates monthly and semestral reports for projects the Institute's students might be enroled in. [You should check it out!](https://github.com/ifspvislab/ifsp-report-bot) 
###### Currently, I'm looking into exploring the world of Java to build solutions to real world problems!
###### Lastly, if you'd like to connect, you can always find me on my [Linkedin!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debora-evilaine-dev/)</sub>
